In this project, we used the NEON instruction set without assembly language and using Intrinsics.  
The idea of this program is to sum two vectors (large arrays of floats) together placing the results in an equally sized third vector. Each of the source vectors are populated with floating point numbers between 0 and 1 chosen at random.
[Here](https://github.com/pkivolowitz/CSC3510-S-2022/tree/main/projects/p5) is the full project specification.
